# Facial and Object Detection

Welcome to Facial and Object Detection! This project implements a Flask-based web application for real-time object and facial detection with face recognition capabilities.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Enables users to perform precise object detection on uploaded images using the MobileNet SSD model trained on the COCO dataset.
- **Facial Recognition**: Achieves real-time face recognition by optimizing the serialization and deserialization of known face encodings using Pickle. This results in faster runtime recognition, enabling efficient and accurate detection tasks.
- **User Interface**: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for developing the application.
- **MobileNet SSD**: Deep learning model for object detection.
- **Pickle**: Python library for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for designing the user interface.
- **COOC Dataset**: Dataset used for training the object detection model.
